# Dotfiles

My dotfiles for configuring various things on macOS.

Feel free to copy/reuse/improve what you like, and if there's something particularly cool you do that I've missed, please share it with me!

## Setup

To automatically apply all dotfiles, run the `install_dotfiles.sh` script. This will require some adjustments: it assumes your `dotfiles` repo is in `~/Dev/`.
